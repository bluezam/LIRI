# Liri
	Have you ever wonder why there isn't a search engine for searching concerts of an artist, searching the artist's spotify songs, and searching informations about movies?
	Well search no further, because Liri is the search engine for you!

# Liri uses multiple search functions! 
	Liri takes a command and calls an api to get the data you're searching for!
	Liri uses multiple npm packages to search the best result you want!

# Using Liri
	Using Liri is as simple as counting 1 2 3! Even your grandma can do it!
	All you have to do is open up an terminal and type "npm install" (without the brackets of course)
	Then you'll be ready to search for the searches you wanted to search.

	Since Liri is in the testing phase, we'll be using node to function the searches.
	There are 3 main ways to use Liri to search for what you're searching for!
	Simpley type the following to search what you've been searching for!

	Concert-this followed by an artist name.
	Spotify-this-song followed by a song name.
	Movie-this followed by a movie name.
